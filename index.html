                  The Cape is full of mountains and provides a mecca of climbing. Cape Town being the main center is a good base to start from. There are a few clubs mainly the MCSA Cape Town Section which has over 1200 members and a bouldering wall in their club room. The University also has a good bouldering wall and there is a climbing gym in Cape Town too. Good climbing is only a few minutes drive from Cape Town and the furthermost areas about 4-5 hours away.

The South African Climbing Academy offers training courses for school learners and adults wanting to learn about rock climbing and bouldering, as well as being a training facility for rock climbers.
                     Our wall was designed by Andrew Pedley, a top South African climber. The simple angled design opens many options for specialised training such as power endurance. The training walls are angled at 15º, 30º, 45 º, 90 º, and are 4.8m in height (In accordance with the IFSC standard for bouldering) but climbing for junior and beginner climbers is only to the 3 m red line.
                     The training routes are colour marked according to various difficulties (based on the Fontainebleau circuit grading system).
